  // The "How to Use" Section
  instructions: [
    "1. TAPPING THE CHIP: At the conclusion of the Evening Chronicle, tap the Thoth Chip (Silicon Scarab). This triggers an atomic dispersal of data, clearing your active board and populating the Library.",
    "2. CONSULT THE SCROLLS: Access the Archives via the new sidebar gate. Note that the most recent day automatically expands to show your 'Wins' and 'Shadow Work' in high-fidelity neon.",
    "3. OBSERVE THE GLOW: Tiles in the Archives now feature a constant cyber-glow. Active tiles scale and brighten, while inactive scrolls maintain a steady neon resonance.",
    "4. TOMORROW'S PROPHECY: Your 'Tomorrow's Main Quest' is now permanently visible on your archived cards, serving as a reminder of the intentions you spoke into existence.",
    "5. THE CLEANSING: Trust in the Scarab; upon sealing, your daily deeds are archived and your board is cleansed, ready for the Midnight Scribe's fresh inscriptions."
  ],

  devNote: "By integrating the batch-commit dispersal, we have finally linked the active ritual to the historical record. The archives are now a living timeline of lived Ma'at, protected by the Silicon Scarab and the Silicon Scribe alike. Order is absolute."
