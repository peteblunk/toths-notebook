      title: "Duamutef Sentinel Protocol",
      description: "Replaced the common CyberJar with the Duamutef Sentinel. Every banishment now flows through a protective failsafe portal, preventing accidental loss of Khet and honoring the transition of matter.",

  // The "How to Use" Section
  instructions: [
    "1. MASTER THE SENTINEL: Touch the Red Head or the Sacred Vessel to summon the Banishment Portal. You must bow (confirm) before Khet is cast into the void.",
    "2. THE BREATH OF SANCTITY: Watch the Ankh pulse. A slow breath indicates a task in waiting; a steady glow signifies a ritual sanctified.",
    "3. NAVIGATE THE VOID: Use the Sidebar's illuminated gateways to switch between Temporal (Time) and Essence (Category) filters without the interference of hover-ghosts.",
    "4. RESPECT THE CONSTANTS: Remember that Daily Rituals are the bedrock of the Temple; they cannot be banished, only performed or restored.",
    "5. ESCAPE WITH GRACE: The new Lunar (White) Escape button provides a clear path back to the scroll without committing changes to the fire."
  ],

  devNote: "By integrating the Duamutef failsafe, we have bridged the gap between 'Delete' and 'Ritual.' The system now treats the removal of Khet as a meaningful transition, not merely a loss of data. Ma'at is restored."
