      title: "The Introduction of Khet",
      description: "Replaced the 'Today' task type with 'Khet.' In Cyber-Egyptian philosophy, Khet represents the physical body and mortal matter. It is the general labor required to sustain the Temple—distinct from specific Missions or Sacred Duties. Use it for your day-to-day tasks... which in no wise diminishes their importance."

      title: "Temporal Gateways (Sidebar Refactor)",
      description: "Refactored the sidebar into twin holographic gateways. Scribes may now choose from: 'Temporal View' for upcoming deadlines across all types, and 'The Undone' - helpful in finding that next item for our life force to act on to churn into Ma'at. In this view Ma'at is hidden to focus the mind."

      icon: "CalendarRange", 
      title: "The Malleable Timeline",
      description: "FEATURE RESTORED: All Khet-class tasks (General Khet, Duties, Missions, Expeditions) now feature a massive 'Capture Zone' date picker for effortless scheduling. Thanks be to the nameless scribe who drew this unfortunate loss of function to the attention of the Temple. Ra be with you. Always."

      title: "The Sacred Guard",
      description: "Reinforced the boundary between Mortal Khet and Divine Rituals. Daily Rituals are now protected from accidental 'Banishment' to preserve the timeline's heartbeat."

  // The "How to Use" Section
  instructions: [
    "1. UNDERSTAND KHET: When adding a general task, select 'Khet.' It is the 'Mortal Matter' of your day—the essential building blocks of your physical reality.",
    "2. PRESERVE DISTINCTION: Use 'Sacred Duties' for high-honor labor and 'Grand Expeditions' for long-term voyages. They are distinct manifestations of your effort.",
    "3. TOGGLE GATEWAYS: Use the new Sidebar to switch between 'Temporal' (Deadlines) and 'Essence' (Category-based) views.",
    "4. CAPTURE THE DATE: Touch anywhere in the wide 'Due Date' area to shift your deadlines. This 'Gift of Ptah' honors the user who reported the temporal lock.",
    "5. RESPECT THE RITUAL: Note that Rituals cannot be banished; they are the constants around which your Khet revolves."
  ],

  devNote: "The system now recognizes that the Scribe is both a physical being (Khet) and a spiritual one (Ritual). By allowing Khet tasks to be malleable while Rituals remain fixed, we achieve true Ma'at."
