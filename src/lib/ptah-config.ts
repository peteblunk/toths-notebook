    - **Visual Restoration:** The tasks of Nun (Incomplete) have regained their neon resonance and deep void aesthetics.
    - **Artifacts of Power:** The standard tools have been replaced. Wield the **Feather of Ma'at** (Stylus) to edit reality, and the **Canopic Jar** to banish unwanted tasks.
    - **Golden Steps:** Subtasks no longer fade into obscurity; upon completion, they are transmuted into **Gold**, honoring your progress toward Ma'at.
    - **Mobile Attunement:** Touch interfaces have been optimized for the traveling scribe.
    - **Daily Rituals:** The management interface has been harmonized with the new design language.
