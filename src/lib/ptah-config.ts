      - Implemented the 'Nun' interface: Incomplete tasks now float in the primordial waters (Chaos).
      - Established the 'Ma'at' interface: Completed tasks are sanctified and are added to the foundation of universal Ma'at (Order) which it is our sacred duty to build. We thank you for your dutiful service.
      - In these early days - you may expect frequent Gifts from Ptah.
