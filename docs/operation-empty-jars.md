🏺 Operation: Empty Jars
Detailed Phased Campaign for Zero-Knowledge Architecture Status: Initiation Phase (Inkscape Masonry in Progress)

Architect: Scribe Peter | Guardian: Djehuty

🏛️ Phase 1: The Hidden Forge (Cryptographic Foundation)
Focus: Establishing the mathematical laws of the Inner Sanctum.

[X] 1.1 The Web Crypto Engine

[-] 1.2 The 12-Word Mnemonic (MOVED TO PHASE III)

[X] 1.3 Local Storage Strategy

[X] 1.4 Prototype Test

🏮 Phase 2: The Istanbul Protocol (The Security Interface)
Focus: Building the Obelisk and the user ritual.

[ ] 2.1 The Istanbul Dial: (SVG Tracing of the Theodosius Obelisk and glyphs in inkscape)
    Status: Underway - approximately 50% complete as of 1/17/5526
    
[ ] 2.1.2 Visual Feedback: The "Centrifugal Vortex" animation. Glyphs fall from the shaft, orbit the pedestal, and snap into the 3x4 grid.

[X] 2.2 The Pattern Lock: Logic to capture 4-glyph sequence.

[-] 2.3 The "Stash" Vault: (MOVED TO PHASE III).

[-] 2.4 Visual Feedback: (MOVED TO PHASE III).

🏗️ Phase 3: The Great Migration & The Vault
Focus: Moving existing data and finalizing the recovery rituals.

[ ] 3.0 The 12-Word Mnemonic: BIP-39 implementation.

[ ] 3.1 The "Stash" Vault: UI for the "Oblique Hint" system.



[ ] 3.3 The Migration Ritual: One-time bridge for existing users.

[ ] 3.4 Streak Preservation: Metadata remains unencrypted for "Celebration Logic."

⚡ Phase 4: The Scribe’s Initiation (New Sign-Up Flow)
Focus: Onboarding the "Initiate of the First Hour" with transparency and wonder.

[ ] 4.1 The "Gibberish" Reveal: * Implement a "Live Mirror." As the user types their first task during sign-up, a side-panel shows the text transforming into AES-GCM cipher-text in real-time.

[ ] 4.2 The Privacy Covenant: * Display the "Corrupt Scribe" warning. Explicitly state: “We provide the forge; you own the sword.”

[ ] 4.3 The Bio-Gate Integration: * Implement WebAuthn (FaceID/TouchID) as a secondary "Master’s Recognition" to bypass manual PIN entry for daily use.

[ ] 4.4 Modular Recovery Options (The "Horcrux" Prep):

UI placeholders for "Cloud-Wrapped Backup" and "Social Shards" as opt-in rituals after the initial account creation.

📜 The Sacred Constraints (The Ma'at of Code)
Zero Visibility: Server NEVER sees the Password, 12-words, or Master Key.

The Scribe's Burden: If the Key and Mnemonic are lost, the data remains "Gibberish" forever.

Bio-Sovereignty: Biometrics are a shortcut to the key, not a replacement for the secret.
