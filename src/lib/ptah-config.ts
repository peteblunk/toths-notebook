  releaseNotes: `
    - **The Morning Gate:** The temple now demands intention before action. You must seal your commitment to Ma'at before entering the workspace.
    - **The Oath of Commitment:** A new, golden Foundation Stone task is laid daily to support your accomplishments in the Ma'at section.
    - **Night Owl Protocol:** The day officially resets at 3:05 AM, allowing late-night scribes to finish their battles in the Duat before the new sun rises.
    - **Visual Polish:** Enhanced clarity for mobile interfaces and text rendering.
    - **Bespoke Artifacts:** Includes the new CyberAnkh icon, hand-rendered in Inkscape (after an utterance from Ptah, of course!)
